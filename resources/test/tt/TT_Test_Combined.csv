3;The standard mode keeps traditional businesses and operations running, while a disruptive mode seeks additional opportunities to exploit new markets and innovate in technologies, processes, products, or services.;none
5;It impacts the whole organization, especially operational processes, resources, internal and external users.;none
37;It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure.;none
45;And ultimately, it changes customer expectations and creates new business opportunities.;none
47;The idea is to use technology not just to replicate an existing service in a digital form, but to use technology to transform that service into something significantly better.;none
53;Companies, in particular, can benefit from this change by realigning their business models. ;none
55;Within a company itself, it requires a cultural shift in how processes are completed.;none
59;Every organization has a slightly different journey toward transformation as they move to adopt the latest technologies, expand their information management ecosystems and improve operational processes.;none
75;The most successful transformations we have seen focus as much (or more) on how to drive change as on the detailed content of the change. ;none
79;The executives we interviewed report feeling pressure to transform from forces inside and outside the company.;none
82;Many firms are building analytics capability to understand customers in more detail.;none
92; Only the top of the company can create a compelling vision of the future and communicate it throughout the organization.;none
94;Transformation does not happen without investment. ;none
95;While some were able to reassign or retrain existing employees for the new vision, most found it necessary to acquire skills from outside.;none
96;Respondents nearly universally described the difficulty of finding the right skills to manage new initiatives or to change work methods. ;none
108; A strong interdependency between digital transformation and sustainability transformation was also found, with decision makers identifying that digital transformation is key to building their sustainability initiatives.;none
109;Environmental, social and economic sustainability is a pressing issue that individuals, businesses, and governments have to address. Sustainability is now not only a matter of corporate differentiation, but also a matter of survival.;none
110;Examples include the reduction of energy usage and CO 2 emissions through continuous monitoring and the reduction of waste by implementing end-to-end traceability.;none
114;We face global environmental, social and economic crises from climate change and biodiversity loss, through to inequality and an aging society.;none
115;Using data and digital technologies to transform business processes and develop sustainability innovation.;none
117;Our survey has validated that successful sustainability transformation and mature digital transformation go hand-in-hand.;none
118;For example, many organizations across various industries use digital technology to monitor CO 2 emissions, both within their organizations and through their value chains.;none
119;In our survey, we found that organizations applied data and digital technologies to improve sustainability across a wide range of use cases. ;none
120;Sustainability transformation leaders execute their organization-wide digital transformation strategies under the clear leadership of their CEOs.;none
121;It is also about fundamentally transforming the way organizations operate their businesses and continuously reinventing themselves;none
123;While corporate purpose is strongly recognized by the CEO and leadership team, a significant 43% of respondents believe their employees have yet to understand and resonate with their corporate purpose and take actions to achieve it.;none
125;Their visions and leadership, however, need to be mobilized across their organizations, enabling all employees to embrace their corporate purpose and proactively execute necessary transformational initiatives.;none
127;Data and analytics capabilities help organizations manage both financial and non-financial KPIs. ;none
128;Furthermore, advanced digital technologies such as AI, IoT and blockchain will help to transform business processes and enhance the value of products and services to meet sustainability demands from various stakeholders.;none
129;To deliver value from sustainability transformation consistently, organizations need to continue developing their data and digital capabilities. ;none
130;Given the key role of digital technology and the gravity of the sustainability agenda, organizations should work closely with their technology partners to build and enable successful sustainability strategy.;none
132;Transformations succeed when they are incremental, cost-effective, and sustainable.;none
158;Because we are convinced that being a role model in terms of #sustainability and #digitalization benefits our planet, our customers and our employees – and is a key prerequisite for Infineon’s profitable growth. ;none
159;Focus, cross-functional collaboration and an end-to-end view as well as a clear orientation on the outcome instead of output – these are the guiding principles on our way to become more #sustainable, more #digital, and more #resilient. ;none
161;Sustainability and digital transformation are two influential issues of our time and deserve more attention;none
164;Digital transformation and social sustainability cannot be separated and therefore belong together.;none
166;The performance uplift was largely independent of the transformation focus, indicating that companies are doing a good job on one of the key components of an integrated strategy: focusing transformation programs on where they can drive most value.;none
186;A sustainable business seeks to create long-term stakeholder value by factoring social, economic and/or environmental impacts into strategic and operational decisions.;none
191;Achieving ESG goals and building sustainability as a competitive advantage requires integrating technology and data from the beginning.;none
192;Sustainability is at the top of corporate agendas worldwide, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals have become major considerations in companies’ digital transformation programs.;none
193;Companies that are successful in their digital transformations are almost twice as likely as other organizations to see ESG goals as a key focus of digital initiatives.;none
194;Our latest research indicates that digital capabilities are critical enablers for sustainability initiatives and that there are digital prerequisites for achieving sustainability goals.;none
195;We call this mindset technology ecoadvantage—using advanced technologies and ways of working to enable profitable solutions that also have a positive impact on ESG goals. ;none
197;For leaders that think broadly about how to advance their sustainability initiatives, technology can act as a major accelerant.;none
199;Emma Okonji AVEVA, a global leader in industrial software, driving digital transformation and sustainability, will highlight how digital technologies can support public-private partnerships and unlock innovation to close the implementation gap on climate change at COP27.;none
209;If you think the disruption caused by digital has been far-reaching, just wait. That impact will pale in comparison to the changes coming as companies wrestle with how to transform their businesses to become truly sustainable.;none
223;Once they have clearly articulated those business cases, companies should ensure that key areas of the business—including marketing, sales, product development, and finance—have the capabilities not only to capture the value created, but also to track and measure it accurately.;none
226;They should look for places in those new markets where they have unique advantages, and create new offerings and business models to leverage those advantages.;none
231;Already, a number of companies are investing in innovation to address the gap, including through investments in R&D and recycling infrastructure.;none
234;In supply chains, for example, they have an opportunity to create end-to-end transparency, from sourcing through distribution. New tools and technologies are critical in this area. AI can help companies monitor, predict, and reduce their carbon emissions.;none
304;Our core purpose is to support transformation processes by helping people, teams, and organizations become more effective at making positive change.;none
308;This realisation of market opportunities is not trivial. It demands from the organisation a lot of attention, flexibility and an openness for change – very often fast and radical change.;none
318;Their ability to transform their firm is critical to surviving and capitalizing on a new wave of business disruption. ;none
333;In his literature review,Footnotei he found that the most frequently used approaches to studying transformation were: deliberate transformation, progressive transformation, regime shift (resilience), societal transition (transition theory), social practices, transformational adaptation and socioecological transition.;none
343;Organizations combining commitment to sustainability with execution capabilities—and integrating this effort with digital transformation—create win-win situations.;none
360;Concurrently, rapid technology innovation and new business models are making the economics of sustainability more viable than ever before. Renewables are more affordable. Data and technology has made managing resources more effective. ;none
361;"Both transformations need to be actively designed, whereby sustainability and digitization do not have to be considered side by side, but rather together in the sense of ""digitainability"".";none
362;The issues of sustainability and digitization are among the central challenges of our time. ;none
363;"The concept ""digitainability"" as a fusion of the terms ""digitization"" and ""sustainability"" emphasizes possible positive reinforcement effects of digitization and sustainability, which have so far been often neglected";none
364;It describes the ability to combine positive aspects of digitization and sustainable development and thus advance both digitization and sustainable development. At the same time, however, the central challenges and possible negative effects with regard to ecological, economic and social issues must also be kept in mind.;none
365;Universities like the TUM play a central role in the design of digital and sustainable transformation processes as learning environments concerning the education for sustainable / digital development, as incubators for innovations in the field of sustainability and digitization, and as role models for local economic, social, ecological and technological developments.;none
366;Under the motto “Digital Sustainability Transformation of, by, and for the TUM”, the project is helping to bring sustainability to life as a leitmotif in the TUM's development agenda.;none
367;For this purpose the project will map the different aspects of digitalization and artificial intelligence systemically onto the more than 200 indicators of the UN Agenda 2030 (and national sustainability strategies derived from the Agenda 2030). ;none
368;The results of the projects should support and objectify the discussions on the relation between digitalization and sustainability.;none
370;Digitainability – a merge of the terms “digitalization” and “sustainability”, referring to the cross-fertilization between the processes of digitalization and sustainable development.;none
371;Digitalization is a major driver of change in many aspects of our lives, and there is an intense debate whether it impacts sustainable development positively or negatively. ;none
407;In February 2022, Fujitsu commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a survey to explore the state of sustainability transformation and how digital transformation is enabling this change with 1,800 decision makers across in nine countries. The survey findings revealed that sustainability is becoming a top business priority.;none
408;A strong interdependency between digital transformation and sustainability transformation was also found, with decision makers identifying that digital transformation is key to building their sustainability initiatives.;none

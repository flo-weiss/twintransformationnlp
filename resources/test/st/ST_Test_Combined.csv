106;Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies.;none
107;While many organizations have already embarked on their sustainability transformation, their maturity still has ways to go.;none
111;Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies. ;none
116;Empowering employees to deliver sustainability innovation and building a culture of trust and empathy.;none
124;A strong emphasis on sustainability in the organizational culture has to be mobilized beyond the C-suite to reach across all employees. ;none
126;At the early stage of the sustainability transformation journey, organizations have relied on the strong leadership of their CEOs and senior executives. ;none
131;Building open, robust ecosystems is very important to co-create new sustainability value. ;none
146;Both industries have begun work on sustainability and are now working along the decarbonization path to realizing zero emissions from their activities.;none
163;Sustainable economic activity means understanding and managing the impact of the own business activities on environment, social issues, and corporate governance. ;none
208;Fundamentally, digital transformation is the accumulation of modern tools and processes to solve market challenges and provides possibilities for upbeat consumer intimacy.;none
210;The scale of the disruption that will play out over the next few decades, along with the opportunity it creates, will be staggering. Just the push to limit global temperature increases to 1.5�C�the central sustainability challenge of our time�will drive a massive transformation of the global economy and�require investments totaling an estimated $100 trillion to $150 trillion by 2050.;none
211;Sustainability, a company's ability to create positive environmental and societal impact, is rapidly reshaping competitive advantage. It is remaking whole industries, blurring and in some cases obliterating boundaries between industries, and generating new waves of growth.;none
212;To succeed and create a competitive advantage, companies must simultaneously integrate an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) lens into every element of the business and capture the value that this transformation creates.;none
213;But while the opportunity is clear, the way to drive a successful�sustainability transformation�is less obvious. ;none
214;Develop a sustainability strategy anchored in purpose. Capture business value. Build new sustainable businesses. Make the core sustainable. Build capabilities. Own the narrative, and engage investors and stakeholders.;none
215;On the basis of our extensive experience working with companies and investors to drive sustainability transformations, we have identified six actions that distinguish leaders from the rest of the pack. ;none
216;On the other hand, companies that execute effectively in all six areas will truly transform their business and turn sustainability into a competitive advantage.;none
217;Companies that fail to take up the challenge, and instead continue to view sustainability through a compliance or ESG reporting lens, will miss the opportunity to tap into lucrative new markets and create new, winning business models. ;none
218;Companies must devise a strategy that takes as its starting point the principle that sustainability is a source of durable competitive advantage. The strategy must clearly connect to the�company�s purpose, focus on long-term value creation, and be driven from the top, including the CEO and board.;none
219;This assessment will likely reveal opportunities to enhance the environmental and societal benefits that the company generates, but it will also strengthen the company�s competitiveness by improving the resilience of its business model.;none
220;To outline a clear strategy, companies should step back and look at their performance in all material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) areas. Then they should focus on the areas that matter the most to all stakeholders�not just to investors�today and in the future, and where outperformance can contribute most significantly to long-term business success. That prioritization is critical to helping companies avoid the all-too-common pitfall of creating a profusion of siloed initiatives that ultimately have little impact.;none
221;At the same time, companies can reassess their existing business model with the objective of understanding its degree of sustainability. ;none
222;Companies that lead in sustainability, as reflected in ESG performance, can also outperform their rivals financially. But capturing the value that sustainability efforts create can be challenging.;none
224;To start, they must develop a robust business case that accesses all sources of value that their sustainability efforts create. ;none
225; Such efforts will validate the power of the overall sustainability transformation and can be the source of revenues or cost savings to fund other aspects of the journey.;none
227;Companies have a major opportunity to unlock new sources of growth, particularly in relation to the trillions of dollars that the public and private sectors will be investing every year to drive the global economy to net zero carbon emissions. ;none
229;They can, for example, introduce new circular business models to reshape the whole product usage cycle. ;none
230;And they can create new business models or make investments in ventures that address the looming�scarcity of critical sustainability inputs. Consider recycled plastic. Some 45% of demand for recycled polyethylene terephthalate will be unmet by 2025, according to BCG analysis. ;none
232;In addition, companies that embrace�sustainable business model innovation�can help transform entire value chains and ecosystems. ;none
233;Companies that aim to become sustainability leaders must assess and enhance the sustainability of their existing portfolio and operations.;none
235;At the same time, companies can engage suppliers to impose standards, track and improve their performance, and push the ecosystem in which they operate toward greater sustainability. Companies should also re-engineer product designs to make existing products sustainable.�;none
236;Companies that want to drive a sustainability transformation must ensure they have the right capabilities and foundation in place to succeed.;none
237;Second, they need to develop strong, granular data capabilities and robust ESG reporting processes to enable the business to direct and adjust efforts on the basis of real-time performance data and to meet increasingly stringent regulatory reporting standards.�;none
238;First, they must design robust governance of sustainability efforts, both at the board level and within the company itself, including accountability and incentives linked to ESG targets. ;none
239;Fourth, they must embed sustainable business model innovation in the organization.;none
240;Third, they should build new partnerships that allow them to pool resources, combine expertise, co-invest in ways that minimize risks associated with high-fixed-cost investments, and deliver sustainable outcomes at scale more quickly. ;none
241;As a result, companies must embrace an �always-on� mentality toward innovating in sustainability.�;none
242;What qualifies as leading performance in carbon footprint or equitable business practices today, for example, will likely be table stakes in the future. ;none
243;The process of driving sustainable business model innovation will be central to that mentality, allowing companies to assess the degree to which their current business models create positive environmental and societal impacts and to improve that performance over time.;none
244;At the same time, they can own their sustainability story in the public markets and share that story in a way that resonates with investors, rather than letting ratings agencies and investors tell their story for them.�;none
245;Leading companies must create a compelling and distinctive narrative around their sustainability strategy�one that connects and amplifies their purpose. ;none
246;Companies should go beyond the annual or biannual reporting cycle and instead provide real-time ESG measurement and reporting mechanisms that increase investors� confidence in the company�s ability to monitor progress and correct course.�;none
247;Companies can also use ESG measurement to establish clear incentives and accountability mechanisms for employees and leaders.;none
248;Company leaders should view the push toward sustainability not as a compliance exercise or a cost of doing business, but rather as an opportunity to create new value.�;none
249;Driving a successful sustainability transformation requires a fundamental shift in mindset. ;none
250;Stronger consideration of sustainability in society, economy and environment has led to a major rise in responsible investments. More and more governments and institutions are pledging to back a United Nations campaign aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, thereby affecting how companies do business.;none
251;Sustainability is a highly relevant topic with a substantial impact on businesses and their stakeholders. ;none
252;The United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide a framework and guidance for this. Companies need to focus on those aspects which are most important to them.;none
253;"Being a sustainable company means to understand and actively manage the environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") impact along your value chain, and ensuring that your company's business model will remain viable in the future. ";none
254;That's why sustainability should be discussed in the boardroom of every company.;none
255;But it's important to move beyond: integrating sustainability into a company's strategy, operating model and day-to-day processes makes it possible to unleash the full potential that sustainability offers for value creation. ;none
256;As far as sustainability is concerned, many companies still rely too heavily on regulatory compliance. This aspect is certainly vital to keeping a licence to operate. ;none
257;Companies currently find themselves at completely different points along their ESG transformation journey, dealing with manifold issues and challenges.;none
258;It takes a holistic approach to integrate sustainability within all aspects of a business � and a tailored strategy for every company. ;none
259;To successfully transform themselves into a sustainable company requires a holistic approach to their strategy, operating model and management system. In addition, companies need to focus on a set of functional aspects depending on their strategic agenda.;none
260;Place a clear focus around a selected set of highly relevant impact areas � leveraging the SDGs � and describe how your focus areas create value - for you and for your stakeholders.�;none
261;Your sustainability agenda must not be isolated from your business agenda: your corporate and business strategy should be closely interwoven with your sustainability strategy. ;none
262;Efforts to accomplish sustainability goals must be evident within the organisation and translated into performance targets and incentive systems for (senior) executives. You can also leverage your corporate culture and implement sustainability into your framework for employees, processes, risks and technologies.;none
263;For instance, the board could form a sustainability committee, or another body with respective focus. To measure and steer progress, existing processes and metrics systems can be used or new ones need to be established. ;none
264;Sustainability has to be embedded within an existing organisational structure. ;none
265;Companies need to develop a holistic sustainability strategy that focuses on the relevant action areas � i.e., those which the stakeholders consider material � and defines clear strategic objectives. These need to be incorporated within the corporate strategy, backed up by concrete actions and made operational;none
266;Pressures toward sustainability are reaching a tipping point. How can businesses accelerate their sustainability transformation to find new opportunities and avenues for growth?;none
267;Many will need to sustainably transform their business models to find new opportunities and avenues for growth for their future business.;none
268;Climate change is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude that threatens to multiply a broad range of sustainability risks. Organizations are under increasing pressure to respond. ;none
269;In examining organizations that have started down this path, we have identified three basic actions that have enabled them to turn sustainability from a risk into an opportunity. ;none
270;First, they look�ahead�to understand how they can capture new growth opportunities from sustainability.;none
271;Finally, they look�around�for opportunities to leverage their business ecosystem to help create competitive advantage in a sustainability-focused world.�;none
272;Second, they look�inside, within their business, to find ways to reconfigure their operations to help accelerate the transformation toward greater sustainability. ;none
273;The experience of Unilever over the last decade demonstrates that, despite financial headwinds, undertaking a sustainability transformation can create meaningful business value.;none
274;In his first year, Polman created the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, a decade-long scheme to double the company�s revenue while simultaneously reducing its environmental footprint and increasing its social impact.�;none
275;His commitment to sustainably transform Unilever created excellent returns for its shareholders, delivering a total shareholder return of 290 percent.;none
276;That sustainability agenda, as articulated by the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recognizes that businesses are an essential partner for addressing the SDGs, from contributing finances to providing products and services that address sustainability.;none
277;Businesses may need to transform themselves to thrive in an era where tackling sustainability is becoming an imperative.;none
278;Businesses that see climate change�and sustainability�not only as a threat but as an opportunity might be best placed to unlock new innovations and ignite unexpected collaborations. ;none
279;The combined actions of a range of parties�including communities, consumers, employees, regulators, corporations, and, recently, financial institutions�suggest that the momentum toward sustainability is reaching a tipping point.;none
280;New business pressures toward sustainability make this imperative critical. ;none
281;In 2019, sustainable funds in the United States attracted more than US$4 billion per quarter. Prior to this, flows had never topped US$2 billion in any quarter.;none
282;Financial flows are being redirected toward sustainable practices.;none
283;Regulations are increasingly supporting the adoption of sustainable business practices.;none
284;Growing worker activism is pushing employers toward sustainability.�Workers are emerging as a newly empowered and vocal group with the ability to materially influence a company�s strategy and reputation.�;none

287;Deloitte Global�s 2019 millennial survey found that 42 percent of millennials decided to purchase a company�s products or services because they perceived it to have a positive impact on society or the environment.;none
288;These shifts in consumer behavior are creating market opportunities for sustainable alternatives.�;none
289;A number of high-profile business leaders have recently publicly committed to tackling sustainability issues, with a particular focus on climate change.�;none
290;Fink emphasized BlackRock�s conviction that sustainable and climate-integrated portfolios will provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors, making them a key focus for BlackRock going forward.;none
291;Noting that �we�ve seen sustainable portfolios deliver stronger performance than traditional portfolios during this period,� Fink sees an opportunity to accelerate the trend toward sustainable investment as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 crisis.;none
292;Businesses that want to succeed in the future need to look ahead to the future. Executives need to be aware of the shifts taking place and understand how growing sustainability expectations may shape their company�s and industry�s future.;none

348;Sustainability has roared to the forefront of corporate priorities, with 73% of surveyed executives saying their organizations have set a net-zero carbon emissions goal. ;none
349;While 86% of companies have a sustainability strategy, only 35% have acted on that strategy.;none
350;Companies are taking notice. 53% of surveyed organizations view environmental sustainability as one of their top priorities within 3 years, up from 39% that consider it a top priority today.;none
351;Dabbling at the edges no longer suffices. Achieving sustainability demands transformation.;none
352;Becoming a truly sustainable enterprise is hard. Only 50% of those organizations that see sustainability as a top priority are effective in achieving their environmental sustainability goals. ;none
353;These executives, located in 32 countries around the world, are significantly involved in defining or executing the sustainability strategies at their organizations.;none
354;After the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 and later signed by 175 Parties globally, it increased the urgency for businesses, cities and governments to respond to the threat of climate change and help protect the future of the planet.;none
355;Where sustainability efforts were once a nice to have, ENGIE Impact reported in our recent Global Executive Survey that 83% of successful companies report significant alignment of sustainability initiatives to business strategy.;none
356;In response, more organizations than ever are including sustainability at the core of their strategy and purpose. ;none
357;Like globalization and digitalization, sustainability is a major disruptor for organizations, driven by today's financial, environmental and societal pressures. ;none
358;A World Economic Forum survey of decision-makers reports that climate-related issues make up the top three biggest risks to businesses today.;none
359;Leading companies are proving that greener strategies and operations create real competitive advantage.;none
369;The project digitainable investigates possible positive and negative impacts of the rapid progress in digitalization and artificial intelligence on sustainable development. ;none
372;With its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specified by 169 targets, and more than 200 indicators, the sustainability landscape is charted comprehensively, including such diverse domains as improving health, eradicating poverty, gender equality, climate change and many others.;none
373;The most systematic formulation of our current understanding of sustainability is provided by the UN Agenda 2030, adopted by the UN member states in September 2015. ;none
374;Sustainability is now a business imperative. But how do you effectively evolve from knowing to doing, empowering you to capitalize on new opportunity?;none
375;The program takes you from the why to the how of sustainability enabling you to build smart, sustainable business models that will future-proof your organization and benefit society.;none
376;Leading Sustainable Business Transformation addresses this knowing-doing dilemma, providing you with a complete business transformation journey through the lens of sustainability. ;none
377;I believe that necessary transformations towards a more sustainable world require more than a declaration of commitment to global goals. Multiple actors at multiple levels need to follow a call to collective action.;none
378;Stewarding sustainability transformations across and beyond institutional boundaries means learning the art of transformative process and systems design.;none
379;Since several years, change-makers for sustainability are increasingly working in partnerships between govenments, civil society and the private sector.;none
380;Currently, too many approaches to sustainability operate in isolation from each other, often in competition. ;none
381;Transformation to sustainability is the pathway to co-creating a world that works for 100% of humanity and the planet. It needs to take place at all levels of the (global) society and requires a fundamental change in the way we operate with each other and the planet.;none
382;But how can companies align their business activities in a holistically sustainable way? And can this create a competitive advantage, growth and economic success?;none
383;The starting points for sustainable production are diverse and include socially and environmentally compatible supply chains, raw material and energy efficiency, and circular economy.;none
384;Operating sustainably has become a source of competitive advantage, but unlocking its potential relies on building strong stakeholder relationships.;none
385;This misalignment obstructs the link between sustainability and profitability.;none
386;New research reveals large consensus gaps between leaders and stakeholders on sustainability performance. ;none
387;By closing consensus gaps and operating more sustainably, businesses can deliver greater financial value in tandem with positive environmental and societal impact.;none
388;Sustainable organizations are purpose-led businesses which inspire their people and partners to deliver lasting financial performance, equitable impact and societal value that earns and retains the trust of all stakeholders.;none
389;Business leaders recognize the need to act. When Accenture interviewed executives at the height of the pandemic, 73% of them identified becoming a truly sustainable and responsible business as a top priority for their organization during the next three years. In our latest research, 72% hold firm to that view.;none
390;But our new analysis reveals a misalignment between business leaders and their stakeholders on progress towards sustainability performance. It suggests that the voices of stakeholders are not being heard.;none
391;While leadership teams are broadly convinced that they are on track to operate more sustainably, employees an important stakeholder group as key change-makers in organizations tend to disagree.;none
392;The apparent overconfidence of leadership teams is also evident in how they grade their organizations overall sustainability performance.;none
393;Executives rate the sustainability performance of their organizations higher than other stakeholders.;none
394;Our survey finds that relatively few stakeholders have full faith in the sustainability promises that leadership teams make. Just under half of employees (49%) believe senior leaders walk the talk on sustainability often or always. This falls to 40% of consumers and 38% of local community citizens.;none
395;The ambiguity around sustainability performance is already having a negative impact. ;none
396;These consensus gaps are leading to an erosion of trust that can be felt across the entire enterprise and stymie efforts to shape sustainable organizations that deliver value and impact.;none
397;The credibility and authenticity of company sustainability commitments should concern leadership teams. ;none
398;As such, sustainability remains a second-tier priority, in urgent need of more visibility, data and resources to drive fundamental organizational change.;none
399;The lack of leadership focus on sustainability and on nurturing the stakeholder relationships underpinning it carries an opportunity cost of robust progress and financial outperformance.;none
400;Strong Sustainability DNA is associated with higher financial value and sustainable impact for all stakeholders.;none
401;A truly sustainable organization cannot be shaped in a vacuum. Design of a credible sustainability strategy should be based on building closer stakeholder relationships.;none
402;Transformations to Sustainability is a research programme that aims to make a difference.;none
403;Knowledge about transformations to sustainability is increasing but is still fragmented.;none
404;Environmental, social and economic sustainability is a pressing issue that individuals, businesses, and governments have to address.;none
405;Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies. ;none
406;The survey findings revealed that sustainability is becoming a top business priority.;none
409;While many organizations have already embarked on their sustainability transformation, their maturity still has ways to go. ;none
410;According to the survey, sustainability is now a higher priority for 60% of the surveyed organizations compared to two years ago. Additionally, 41% of respondents consider sustainability as one of their top three management priorities.;none
411;On the flip side, a significant 54% of organizations have yet to execute on sustainability initiatives and are categorized as being non-active.;none
412;In our survey, we found that only 5% of organizations had truly mature sustainability transformation capabilities and can be considered sustainability transformation leaders. ;none
413;New guidelines and obligations, expanded customer demands and, last but not least, nature and our society demand more sustainable action.;none
414;Sustainability is the most pressing issue of our time. Like the digital transformation before it, it is having a significant impact on the business world. ;none
415;Numerous companies have defined their sustainability goals and in some cases these are already broken down to divisional level.;none
416;FUTURE Institute for Sustainable Transformation is a research-based and action-oriented institute for sustainable transformation that creates knowledge and connects the relevant players to transform individuals, organizations, industries and value chains towards sustainable impact.;none
418;To succeed and create a competitive advantage, companies must simultaneously integrate an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) lens into every element of the business and capture the value that this transformation creates.;none
419;But while the opportunity is clear, the way to drive a successful sustainability transformation is less obvious. ;none
420;First of all, aspiring sustainability champions must develop a sustainability strategy anchored in purpose. The strategy must connect to the company's purpose, focus on long-term value creation, and be driven from the top.;none
421;The study underlines that new tools and technologies are critical in making the core more sustainable, for instance in supply chains companies have an opportunity to create end-to-end transparency, from sourcing through distribution.;none
422;Companies that aim to become sustainability leaders must also assess and enhance the sustainability of their existing portfolio and operations. ;none
423;At the same time, they will also need to continue to adapt their operations, product portfolio, and business models as the bar for sustainability inevitably rises over time.;none
424;Companies that want to drive a sustainability transformation must ensure they have the right capabilities and foundation in place to succeed. ;none
425;Reinventing for sustainability and becoming sustainable at the core require profound transformation.;none
433;Systemic change is absolutely necessary for any company to meet their lofty sustainability commitments. Whether by 2025, 2030 or 2040(a little late, but still). This means individuals and companies MUST advocate and vote for comprehensive climate policy. Thank you Michelle Billig Patron and team for the extensive work on Microsoft's energy and carbon policy briefs.;none

To this effect, the company is working closely with its partners in the global supply chain to reduce energy and material consumption and make greater use of green energy sources. adidas aims to achieve climate neutrality in its own operations by 2025 and overall climate neutrality by 2050.
Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies.
While many organizations have already embarked on their sustainability transformation, their maturity still has ways to go.
Environmental, social and economic sustainability is a pressing issue that individuals, businesses, and governments have to address. Sustainability is now not only a matter of corporate differentiation, but also a matter of survival.
Examples include the reduction of energy usage and CO 2 emissions through continuous monitoring and the reduction of waste by implementing end-to-end traceability.
Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies. 
We face global environmental, social and economic crises from climate change and biodiversity loss, through to inequality and an aging society.
While corporate purpose is strongly recognized by the CEO and leadership team, a significant 43% of respondents believe their employees have yet to understand and resonate with their corporate purpose and take actions to achieve it.
A strong emphasis on sustainability in the organizational culture has to be mobilized beyond the C-suite to reach across all employees. 
Given the key role of digital technology and the gravity of the sustainability agenda, organizations should work closely with their technology partners to build and enable successful sustainability strategy.
Building open, robust ecosystems is very important to co-create new sustainability value. 
Both industries have begun work on sustainability and are now working along the decarbonization path to realizing zero emissions from their activities.
Sustainable economic activity means understanding and managing the impact of the own business activities on environment, social issues, and corporate governance. 
A sustainable business seeks to create long-term stakeholder value by factoring social, economic and/or environmental impacts into strategic and operational decisions.
If you think the disruption caused by digital has been far-reaching, just wait. That impact will pale in comparison to the changes coming as companies wrestle with how to transform their businesses to become truly sustainable.
The scale of the disruption that will play out over the next few decades, along with the opportunity it creates, will be staggering. Just the push to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C—the central sustainability challenge of our time—will drive a massive transformation of the global economy and require investments totaling an estimated $100 trillion to $150 trillion by 2050.
Sustainability, a company’s ability to create positive environmental and societal impact, is rapidly reshaping competitive advantage. It is remaking whole industries, blurring and in some cases obliterating boundaries between industries, and generating new waves of growth.
To succeed and create a competitive advantage, companies must simultaneously integrate an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) lens into every element of the business and capture the value that this transformation creates.
But while the opportunity is clear, the way to drive a successful sustainability transformation is less obvious. 
Develop a sustainability strategy anchored in purpose. Capture business value. Build new sustainable businesses. Make the core sustainable. Build capabilities. Own the narrative, and engage investors and stakeholders.
On the basis of our extensive experience working with companies and investors to drive sustainability transformations, we have identified six actions that distinguish leaders from the rest of the pack. 
On the other hand, companies that execute effectively in all six areas will truly transform their business and turn sustainability into a competitive advantage.
Companies that fail to take up the challenge, and instead continue to view sustainability through a compliance or ESG reporting lens, will miss the opportunity to tap into lucrative new markets and create new, winning business models. 
This assessment will likely reveal opportunities to enhance the environmental and societal benefits that the company generates, but it will also strengthen the company’s competitiveness by improving the resilience of its business model.
To outline a clear strategy, companies should step back and look at their performance in all material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) areas. Then they should focus on the areas that matter the most to all stakeholders—not just to investors—today and in the future, and where outperformance can contribute most significantly to long-term business success. That prioritization is critical to helping companies avoid the all-too-common pitfall of creating a profusion of siloed initiatives that ultimately have little impact.
At the same time, companies can reassess their existing business model with the objective of understanding its degree of sustainability. 
Companies that lead in sustainability, as reflected in ESG performance, can also outperform their rivals financially. But capturing the value that sustainability efforts create can be challenging.
To start, they must develop a robust business case that accesses all sources of value that their sustainability efforts create. 
 Such efforts will validate the power of the overall sustainability transformation and can be the source of revenues or cost savings to fund other aspects of the journey.
Companies have a major opportunity to unlock new sources of growth, particularly in relation to the trillions of dollars that the public and private sectors will be investing every year to drive the global economy to net zero carbon emissions. 
They can, for example, introduce new circular business models to reshape the whole product usage cycle. 
And they can create new business models or make investments in ventures that address the looming scarcity of critical sustainability inputs. Consider recycled plastic. Some 45% of demand for recycled polyethylene terephthalate will be unmet by 2025, according to BCG analysis. 
Already, a number of companies are investing in innovation to address the gap, including through investments in R&D and recycling infrastructure.
In addition, companies that embrace sustainable business model innovation can help transform entire value chains and ecosystems. 
Companies that aim to become sustainability leaders must assess and enhance the sustainability of their existing portfolio and operations.
At the same time, companies can engage suppliers to impose standards, track and improve their performance, and push the ecosystem in which they operate toward greater sustainability. Companies should also re-engineer product designs to make existing products sustainable. 
Companies that want to drive a sustainability transformation must ensure they have the right capabilities and foundation in place to succeed.
Second, they need to develop strong, granular data capabilities and robust ESG reporting processes to enable the business to direct and adjust efforts on the basis of real-time performance data and to meet increasingly stringent regulatory reporting standards. 
First, they must design robust governance of sustainability efforts, both at the board level and within the company itself, including accountability and incentives linked to ESG targets. 
Fourth, they must embed sustainable business model innovation in the organization.
Third, they should build new partnerships that allow them to pool resources, combine expertise, co-invest in ways that minimize risks associated with high-fixed-cost investments, and deliver sustainable outcomes at scale more quickly. 
As a result, companies must embrace an “always-on” mentality toward innovating in sustainability. 
What qualifies as leading performance in carbon footprint or equitable business practices today, for example, will likely be table stakes in the future. 
The process of driving sustainable business model innovation will be central to that mentality, allowing companies to assess the degree to which their current business models create positive environmental and societal impacts and to improve that performance over time.
At the same time, they can own their sustainability story in the public markets and share that story in a way that resonates with investors, rather than letting ratings agencies and investors tell their story for them. 
Leading companies must create a compelling and distinctive narrative around their sustainability strategy—one that connects and amplifies their purpose. 
Companies should go beyond the annual or biannual reporting cycle and instead provide real-time ESG measurement and reporting mechanisms that increase investors’ confidence in the company’s ability to monitor progress and correct course. 
Companies can also use ESG measurement to establish clear incentives and accountability mechanisms for employees and leaders.
Company leaders should view the push toward sustainability not as a compliance exercise or a cost of doing business, but rather as an opportunity to create new value. 
Driving a successful sustainability transformation requires a fundamental shift in mindset. 
Stronger consideration of sustainability in society, economy and environment has led to a major rise in responsible investments. More and more governments and institutions are pledging to back a United Nations campaign aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, thereby affecting how companies do business.
Sustainability is a highly relevant topic with a substantial impact on businesses and their stakeholders. 
The United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide a framework and guidance for this. Companies need to focus on those aspects which are most important to them.
"Being a sustainable company means to understand and actively manage the environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") impact along your value chain, and ensuring that your company's business model will remain viable in the future. "
That's why sustainability should be discussed in the boardroom of every company
But it's important to move beyond: integrating sustainability into a company's strategy, operating model and day-to-day processes makes it possible to unleash the full potential that sustainability offers for value creation. 
As far as sustainability is concerned, many companies still rely too heavily on regulatory compliance. This aspect is certainly vital to keeping a licence to operate. 
Companies currently find themselves at completely different points along their ESG transformation journey, dealing with manifold issues and challenges.
It takes a holistic approach to integrate sustainability within all aspects of a business – and a tailored strategy for every company. 
To successfully transform themselves into a sustainable company requires a holistic approach to their strategy, operating model and management system. In addition, companies need to focus on a set of functional aspects depending on their strategic agenda.
Place a clear focus around a selected set of highly relevant impact areas – leveraging the SDGs – and describe how your focus areas create value - for you and for your stakeholders. 
Your sustainability agenda must not be isolated from your business agenda: your corporate and business strategy should be closely interwoven with your sustainability strategy. 
Efforts to accomplish sustainability goals must be evident within the organisation and translated into performance targets and incentive systems for (senior) executives. You can also leverage your corporate culture and implement sustainability into your framework for employees, processes, risks and technologies.
For instance, the board could form a sustainability committee, or another body with respective focus. To measure and steer progress, existing processes and metrics systems can be used or new ones need to be established. 
Sustainability has to be embedded within an existing organisational structure. 
Companies need to develop a holistic sustainability strategy that focuses on the relevant action areas – i.e., those which the stakeholders consider material – and defines clear strategic objectives. These need to be incorporated within the corporate strategy, backed up by concrete actions and made operational
Pressures toward sustainability are reaching a tipping point. How can businesses accelerate their sustainability transformation to find new opportunities and avenues for growth?
Many will need to sustainably transform their business models to find new opportunities and avenues for growth for their future business.
Climate change is a crisis of unprecedented magnitude that threatens to multiply a broad range of sustainability risks. Organizations are under increasing pressure to respond. 
In examining organizations that have started down this path, we have identified three basic actions that have enabled them to turn sustainability from a risk into an opportunity. 
First, they look ahead to understand how they can capture new growth opportunities from sustainability.
Finally, they look around for opportunities to leverage their business ecosystem to help create competitive advantage in a sustainability-focused world. 
Second, they look inside, within their business, to find ways to reconfigure their operations to help accelerate the transformation toward greater sustainability. 
The experience of Unilever over the last decade demonstrates that, despite financial headwinds, undertaking a sustainability transformation can create meaningful business value.
In his first year, Polman created the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, a decade-long scheme to double the company’s revenue while simultaneously reducing its environmental footprint and increasing its social impact. 
His commitment to sustainably transform Unilever created excellent returns for its shareholders, delivering a total shareholder return of 290 percent.
That sustainability agenda, as articulated by the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recognizes that businesses are an essential partner for addressing the SDGs, from contributing finances to providing products and services that address sustainability.
Businesses may need to transform themselves to thrive in an era where tackling sustainability is becoming an imperative.
Businesses that see climate change—and sustainability—not only as a threat but as an opportunity might be best placed to unlock new innovations and ignite unexpected collaborations. 
The combined actions of a range of parties—including communities, consumers, employees, regulators, corporations, and, recently, financial institutions—suggest that the momentum toward sustainability is reaching a tipping point.
New business pressures toward sustainability make this imperative critical. 
In 2019, sustainable funds in the United States attracted more than US$4 billion per quarter. Prior to this, flows had never topped US$2 billion in any quarter.
Financial flows are being redirected toward sustainable practices.
Regulations are increasingly supporting the adoption of sustainable business practices.
Growing worker activism is pushing employers toward sustainability. Workers are emerging as a newly empowered and vocal group with the ability to materially influence a company’s strategy and reputation. 
Companies that fail to meet employee expectations on sustainability may see talent shortages or problems with engagement
Customer preferences are tilting toward sustainable products and services. Continued changes in consumption and purchasing patterns are trending toward a greater overall emphasis on sustainable products and services. 
Deloitte Global’s 2019 millennial survey found that 42 percent of millennials decided to purchase a company’s products or services because they perceived it to have a positive impact on society or the environment.
These shifts in consumer behavior are creating market opportunities for sustainable alternatives. 
A number of high-profile business leaders have recently publicly committed to tackling sustainability issues, with a particular focus on climate change. 
Fink emphasized BlackRock’s conviction that sustainable and climate-integrated portfolios will provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors, making them a key focus for BlackRock going forward.
Noting that “we’ve seen sustainable portfolios deliver stronger performance than traditional portfolios during this period,” Fink sees an opportunity to accelerate the trend toward sustainable investment as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 crisis.
Businesses that want to succeed in the future need to look ahead to the future. Executives need to be aware of the shifts taking place and understand how growing sustainability expectations may shape their company’s and industry’s future.
As an example, in December 2019, Goldman Sachs announced a US$750 billion commitment to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies.
Investor pressure is pushing the clean energy transition forward in the fossil fuel industry, threatening its profitability while also creating avenues for new business models. 
By innovating for sustainability, businesses can also identify ways to accelerate toward their future business.
Depending on the magnitude of the sustainability risks and opportunities they face, some companies may find that they need to go beyond integrative approaches—which seek to weave sustainability into existing business models, strategies, products, and services—to transformative approaches in which sustainability considerations drive the design of new business models, strategies, products, and services.
By viewing sustainability through the lens of growth and opportunity, businesses have been able to apply their creativity and innovation to tackle some sustainability challenges while also opening up new business models, strategies, products, and services. 
The platform offers subscribers a line of sight into the environmental and social footprint of raw ingredients by providing access to a range of metrics and insights into the efforts underway to improve sustainability performance.
They can then look around to support their sustainability transformation and may gain competitive advantage by tapping into their broader business ecosystem. This strategy begins with the realization that it is not always necessary for businesses to build the capabilities—the knowledge, skills, and technology—or the influence needed to transform in-house.
If the needed capabilities exist within others in their ecosystem, businesses should consider seeking to engage and mobilize ecosystem partners to help support their own sustainability transformation.
Executives can look around in two ways: first, by leveraging others’ capabilities to accelerate their sustainability transformation, and second, leveraging others’ influence to create a favorable environment for their transformed business.
Looking ahead, looking inside, and looking around can help companies understand not only how the pressures toward sustainability could be a threat to their current business, but what opportunities they may hold for their future business.
Many businesses will likely need to radically transform their business models to respond to shifting market conditions calling for greater sustainability.
The term sustainability has a variety of meanings in different contexts. Some use it to focus on longevity, and it often has a moral or ethical taste to it. As the “triple bottom line” it stands for “planet, people and profit”
We only will succeed in this if we can help our leadership to transform from being driven by short-term goals to a long-term and sustainability focus.
“In order to be perceived as a sustainable organisation by our customers we need to live sustainability. 
Their perception was that sustainability is “a nice add-on, but not relevant
If I am interested in the topic of sustainability, and if I believe in its value for an organisation, then I see lots of possibilities to talk about it with my clients
"“How can we overcome the mental barriers or resistance toward the issues of sustainability among our leaders?"""
As a first step it was important for our client to come up with an appropriate definition and understanding sustainability.
Integrating sustainability per se means dealing with a broader complexity, because we add other dimensions, like social, ecological and wellbeing indicators.
Raise awareness about what is happening within the firm’s practice, and within the field of sustainability generally
Create a mechanism for spreading best practices in sustainability around your organisation more quickly and effectively.
Achieve clarity on global and regional sustainability reporting strategy.
Pursue a more concerted program to internally embed sustainability thinking and practice within the firm.
Their ability to transform their firm is critical to surviving and capitalizing on a new wave of business disruption. 
Becoming an environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable business demands a profound and fundamental change. 
Over the coming years, sustainability will become a top priority for CEOs. 
Traditional firms willing to start their multiyear transformation journey toward sustainability must embrace three key principles:
"Seven of them relate directly to environmental sustainability; others, like gender equality or quality education, can help firms define how they play a wider role in building a sustainable society to win stakeholder trust."
The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defined 17 interrelated sustainable development goals. 
Carbon offsets, compensation, and philanthropy address the symptoms, not the cause.
To understand the key drivers of sustainability transformation and learn from best practices to build trust and develop sustainability as a new competitive advantage, clients can access this brand-new report, The Future Of Business Is Sustainability.
There is a call to change societies to become more sustainable. We examine how the concept of sustainability transformation has been used and find that it has been defined in many ways.
There is a need to further clarify what sustainability transformation means and how it can be assessed.
The concept is still used without many real-world examples – we found only four studies that had assessed whether a multi-sectoral sustainability transformation had taken place. 
Sustainability transformation brings together two concepts: sustainability and transformation.
The concept of sustainability originates from the most commonly used definition of sustainable development, which states that we should meet the needs of the present human population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
Environmental sustainability has been assessed in different ways, such as with the ecological footprint and ecosystem services approaches.
 For example, the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services states that the sustainability goals for 2030 and beyond may only be achieved through transformative changes, meaning fundamental, system-wide reorganization across technological, economic and social factors
In his literature review,Footnotei he found that the most frequently used approaches to studying transformation were: deliberate transformation, progressive transformation, regime shift (resilience), societal transition (transition theory), social practices, transformational adaptation and socioecological transition.
The concepts of transformation and transition are both used in studying sustainability change, often as synonyms.
Hence, our aim with this article is to advance the discussion on how to assess sustainability transformations.
Considered together, sustainability transformation is still a relatively new concept that needs closer examination, particularly in terms of how it is operationalized. 
In this review, we contribute to the transformations literature by systematically reviewing multi-sectoral sustainability transformation studies to see whether and how they assess sustainability transformations and to synthesizing the findings to map out future research questions.
As a social phenomenon, a sustainability transformation takes place across scales of social organization.
Sustainability transformation discourses commonly criticize unlimited economic growth
It is the combination between political will and local, people-centred approaches that drives the success of urban sustainability transformations.
That is, a strategy of incremental change with a transformative agenda, where a normative focus on sustainability transformations helps to orient incremental efforts (such as policy change) within a broader narrative of transformative change.
Achieving sustainability demands transformation.
Numerous organizations are involved in sustainability initiatives and they need a holistic vision to achieve sustainability. 
Organizations that acknowledge and embrace the key drivers for sustainability will obtain the ultimate benefits of market opportunities and efficient business operations. 
Customers, employees, investors, business partners, and governments are pressuring corporate management and boards to place sustainability at the top of their corporate agendas.
Sustainability has roared to the forefront of corporate priorities, with 73% of surveyed executives saying their organizations have set a net-zero carbon emissions goal. 
While 86% of companies have a sustainability strategy, only 35% have acted on that strategy.
Companies are taking notice. 53% of surveyed organizations view environmental sustainability as one of their top priorities within 3 years, up from 39% that consider it a top priority today.
Dabbling at the edges no longer suffices. Achieving sustainability demands transformation.
Becoming a truly sustainable enterprise is hard. Only 50% of those organizations that see sustainability as a top priority are effective in achieving their environmental sustainability goals. 
These executives, located in 32 countries around the world, are significantly involved in defining or executing the sustainability strategies at their organizations.
After the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 and later signed by 175 Parties globally, it increased the urgency for businesses, cities and governments to respond to the threat of climate change and help protect the future of the planet.
Where sustainability efforts were once a “nice to have,” ENGIE Impact reported in our recent Global Executive Survey that 83% of successful companies report significant alignment of sustainability initiatives to business strategy.
In response, more organizations than ever are including sustainability at the core of their strategy and purpose. 
A World Economic Forum survey of decision-makers reports that climate-related issues make up the top three biggest risks to businesses today.
Leading companies are proving that greener strategies and operations create real competitive advantage.
Concurrently, rapid technology innovation and new business models are making the economics of sustainability more viable than ever before. Renewables are more affordable. Data and technology has made managing resources more effective. 
Universities like the TUM play a central role in the design of digital and sustainable transformation processes as learning environments concerning the education for sustainable / digital development, as incubators for innovations in the field of sustainability and digitization, and as role models for local economic, social, ecological and technological developments.
With its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specified by 169 targets, and more than 200 indicators, the sustainability landscape is charted comprehensively, including such diverse domains as improving health, eradicating poverty, gender equality, climate change and many others. 
The most systematic formulation of our current understanding of sustainability is provided by the UN Agenda 2030, adopted by the UN member states in September 2015. 
Sustainability is now a business imperative. But how do you effectively evolve from knowing to doing, empowering you to capitalize on new opportunity?
The program takes you from the why to the how of sustainability enabling you to build smart, sustainable business models that will future-proof your organization and benefit society.
Leading Sustainable Business Transformation addresses this knowing-doing dilemma, providing you with a complete business transformation journey through the lens of sustainability. 
I believe that necessary transformations towards a more sustainable world require more than a declaration of commitment to global goals. Multiple actors at multiple levels need to follow a call to collective action.
Stewarding sustainability transformations  across and beyond institutional boundaries means learning the art of transformative process and systems design.
Since several years, change-makers for sustainability are increasingly working in partnerships between govenments, civil society and the private sector.
Currently, too many approaches to sustainability operate in isolation from each other, often in competition. 
Transformation to sustainability is the pathway to co-creating a world that works for 100% of humanity and the planet. It needs to take place at all levels of the (global) society and requires a fundamental change in the way we operate with each other and the planet.
But how can companies align their business activities in a holistically sustainable way? And can this create a competitive advantage, growth and economic success?
The starting points for sustainable production are diverse and include socially and environmentally compatible supply chains, raw material and energy efficiency, and circular economy.
Operating sustainably has become a source of competitive advantage, but unlocking its potential relies on building strong stakeholder relationships.
This misalignment obstructs the link between sustainability and profitability.
New research reveals large consensus gaps between leaders and stakeholders on sustainability performance. 
By closing consensus gaps and operating more sustainably, businesses can deliver greater financial value in tandem with positive environmental and societal impact.
Sustainable organizations are purpose-led businesses which inspire their people and partners to deliver lasting financial performance, equitable impact and societal value that earns and retains the trust of all stakeholders.
Business leaders recognize the need to act. When Accenture interviewed executives at the height of the pandemic, 73% of them identified “becoming a truly sustainable and responsible business” as a top priority for their organization during the next three years. In our latest research, 72% hold firm to that view.
But our new analysis reveals a misalignment between business leaders and their stakeholders on progress towards sustainability performance. It suggests that the voices of stakeholders are not being heard.
While leadership teams are broadly convinced that they are on track to operate more sustainably, employees—an important stakeholder group as key change-makers in organizations—tend to disagree.
The apparent overconfidence of leadership teams is also evident in how they grade their organizations’ overall sustainability performance.
Executives rate the sustainability performance of their organizations higher than other stakeholders
Our survey finds that relatively few stakeholders have full faith in the sustainability promises that leadership teams make. Just under half of employees (49%) believe senior leaders “walk the talk” on sustainability “often” or “always”. This falls to 40% of consumers and 38% of local community citizens.
The ambiguity around sustainability performance is already having a negative impact. 
These consensus gaps are leading to an erosion of trust that can be felt across the entire enterprise and stymie efforts to shape sustainable organizations that deliver value and impact.
The credibility and authenticity of company sustainability commitments should concern leadership teams. 
As such, sustainability remains a second-tier priority, in urgent need of more visibility, data and resources to drive fundamental organizational change.
The lack of leadership focus on sustainability—and on nurturing the stakeholder relationships underpinning it—carries an opportunity cost of robust progress and financial outperformance.
Strong Sustainability DNA is associated with higher financial value and sustainable impact for all stakeholders
A truly sustainable organization cannot be shaped in a vacuum. Design of a credible sustainability strategy should be based on building closer stakeholder relationships.
Transformations to Sustainability is a research programme that aims to make a difference.
Knowledge about transformations to sustainability is increasing but is still fragmented.
Environmental, social and economic sustainability is a pressing issue that individuals, businesses, and governments have to address.
Sustainability transformation means transforming business to bring about positive change in our environment, society and economies. 
The survey findings revealed that sustainability is becoming a top business priority.
In February 2022, Fujitsu commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a survey to explore the state of sustainability transformation and how digital transformation is enabling this change with 1,800 decision makers across in nine countries. The survey findings revealed that sustainability is becoming a top business priority.
While many organizations have already embarked on their sustainability transformation, their maturity still has ways to go. 
According to the survey, sustainability is now a higher priority for 60% of the surveyed organizations compared to two years ago. Additionally, 41% of respondents consider sustainability as one of their top three management priorities.
On the flip side, a significant 54% of organizations have yet to execute on sustainability initiatives and are categorized as being non-active.
In our survey, we found that only 5% of organizations had truly mature sustainability transformation capabilities and can be considered sustainability transformation leaders. 
New guidelines and obligations, expanded customer demands and, last but not least, nature and our society demand more sustainable action.
Sustainability is the most pressing issue of our time. Like the digital transformation before it, it is having a significant impact on the business world. 
Numerous companies have defined their sustainability goals and in some cases these are already broken down to divisional level.
FUTURE Institute for Sustainable Transformation  is a research-based and action-oriented institute for sustainable transformation that creates knowledge and connects the relevant players to transform individuals, organizations, industries and value chains towards sustainable impact. 
To succeed and create a competitive advantage, companies must simultaneously integrate an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) lens into every element of the business and capture the value that this transformation creates.
But while the opportunity is clear, the way to drive a successful sustainability transformation is less obvious. 
First of all, aspiring sustainability champions must develop a sustainability strategy anchored in purpose. The strategy must connect to the company’s purpose, focus on long-term value creation, and be driven from the top.
The study underlines that new tools and technologies are critical in making the core more sustainable, for instance in supply chains companies have an opportunity to create end-to-end transparency, from sourcing through distribution.
Companies that aim to become sustainability leaders must also assess and enhance the sustainability of their existing portfolio and operations. 
At the same time, they will also need to continue to adapt their operations, product portfolio, and business models as the bar for sustainability inevitably rises over time.
Companies that want to drive a sustainability transformation must ensure they have the right capabilities and foundation in place to succeed. 
Reinventing for sustainability and becoming sustainable at the core require profound transformation. 
Systemic change is absolutely necessary for any company to meet their lofty sustainability commitments. Whether by 2025, 2030 or 2040(a little late, but still). This means individuals and companies MUST advocate and vote for comprehensive climate policy.
